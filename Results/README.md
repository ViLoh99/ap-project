# Results Folder

Due to size constraints on GitHub repositories, the `Results` folder containing all the processed data and analysis outputs has been stored externally. 

You can access the full `Results` folder, which includes all the `.pkl` files, word clouds, and analysis summaries, via the following link:

[Access the Results Folder on OneDrive]([your-onedrive-link-here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IJ7dBWNeQV3oFPzKPdBOfAFJQqacsukL?usp=sharing))

### Why External Storage?

The OneDrive link includes the Pickle files (`.pkl`) for each time span.

### Instructions
Once you've downloaded the data from OneDrive, place it in the corresponding directory structure within your local copy of the repository for seamless integration with the `read_results.py` script.
